  Bitburner v2.8.1 AUG 2025.
  TUTORIAL from NOOB for NOOBS who don't know how to code and just want to complete the main quest on First play-through (Bitnode 1).
--------------------------------------------------------------  
  Contains spoilers, but you would't care if you are stuck anyway.
  
--------------------------------------------------------------

  
  LIST OF SCRIPTS: theese are scripts I found on github/ reddit/ google search and modified them a bit for my liking.
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. stocktrader5.js  - makes money mid to late game by trading stocks automaticaly. Best for money.

2. go.js (4,55GB RAM) - makes hack xp and money by hacking foodnstuff with all available RAM. Best for hack Xp.
- bin.gr.js - grow function launched automaticaly by go.js. uses private server with highest RAM (all of private servers if they are same RAM size).
- bin.hk.js - hack function launched automaticaly by go.js. uses private server with highest RAM (all of private servers if they are same RAM size).
- bin.wk.js - weaken function launched automaticaly by go.js. uses private server with highest RAM (all of private servers if they are same RAM size).

3. server-delete.js - deletes all bought personal servers (does not delete home PC or servers of companies on web)

4. servbuy1b.js - buys 512GB private servers for 28M. 25x cost 710M total. (if you run out of money it stops buying)
- Copies from home to bought servers 3x bin.js files and early-hack-template.js.
- Launches early-hack-template.js on each server with 182 threads.

5. servbuy2t.js - buys 1048576GB private servers (MAX SIZE) for 58B. 25x cost 1,5T total. (if you run out of money it stops buying)
- Copies from home to bought servers 3x bin.js files and early-hack-template.js.
- Launches early-hack-template.js on each server with 374491 threads.

6. early-hack-template.js (2,80GB ram)- gets you xp and money in early game by hacking harakiri-sushi.
- harakiri-sushi (Hack lvl 40, max$ 100M) is best for money in early game.
- n00dles is for first launch only, you can skip it. (Hack lvl 1, max$ 2,5M)
- foodnstuff is best for XP. (Hack lvl 1, max$ 25M)
- phantasy (Hack lvl 100, max$ 600M) is best for money mid game. After 10B+ stocktrader5.js takes over money making.

- Security of server means minimum hacking skill needed to hack it.
- Faster hacking is when your hack skill is 2x security level. For example 200 hack skill for phantasy and 80 for harakiri-sushi.

7. search.js - find Run for the hillz server (11th level deep. [scan-analyze 10] maxes at 10 levels deep)
- Bitrunners: type [search.js run4theh111z] without brackets in terminal.  Then use [scnan-analyze 10] to conenct to 10th level server. inside 10th level server type [CONNECT run4theh111z]
- Nitesec: avmnite-02h
- Black Hand: I.I.I.I
- Csec: CSEC (case sensitive)
- after connecting to hack group server, just type BACKDOOR and press Enter. you will get hacking group invite.

--------------------------------------------------------------


  END GAME STRATEGY: 
1. [run stocktrader5.js]
2. [run go.js]
3. run server buy script. (stop go.js before buying)
4. wait AFK until several trillion $ (keep around 3 trillion for stock market to make money)
5. sell stock, upgrade HOME PC RAM and CORES
6. sell stock, buy augments
7. install augments (reset/prestige)
8. until you have 2500 hack skill, then [run fl1ght.exe] to join Daedalus. (need 3000 hack level to complete main story level - bitnode1)
   

--------------------------------------------------------------


  STEP01 - Copy files from github to bitburner HOME pc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

- Create all of the files with exact file names on your HOME coputer in bitburner game by typing in terminal NANO FILENAME.js, then copy paste the code from github and click SAVE.

- You can check what files you have on home PC by typing in terminal LS. type HELP for more commands. or read the beginner guide inside bitburner game under DOcumentation tab,
or help articles here: https://bitburner-fork-oddiz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basicgameplay/terminal.html


--------------------------------------------------------------


  STEP02 - make money EARLY GAME
--------------------------------------------------------------

- CRIME
1. go to gym in Sector-12 and train Agility and Dexterity. Let the money go minus 1 million or more. you can train strenghth and defence later too.
2. go to Slums in sector-12 and start doing crime for money. you want dexterity and agility trained high enough so that crime success rate is 70% or higher.
3. Start with Shoplift, then MUG, then Homicide.


- HACK skill
1. You can train hack skill in Sector-12 university.
2. You can train faster in ZB UNI after traveling to Volfhaven.


- HACKNET
1. Buy at least 4 hacknet nodes.
2. upgrade RAM (max 64gb), then LEVEL (max 200), then cores (max 16).
3. In early game buy some RAM and then some Levels, dont buy cores.
4. In mid game max out RAM, buy 150 levels, but buy only 10 cores. 14 nodes is enough to cover stock market costs.
5. In late game max out RAM, LEVELS, buy only 10 cores. u can max everything if u feel like it. stock market makes billions and trillions.
6. It does not pay off to max out cores or buy more than 14 hacknet nodes, unless you plan to AFK or OFFLINE for many days. 
7. You need to buy 30 hacknet nodes for steam achievment (around 1 trillion $)


- SCRIPTS.
1. [run early-hack-template.js -t 2] (with as many threads your home RAM allows. -t = home RAM GB /2,8GB size of script. Example: 32gb server can run -t 11)
2. [run go.js] (automaticaly uses all available RAM). Needs min 4,6 GB RAM on home PC.


--------------------------------------------------------------


  STEP03 - make hack XP MID and LATE game
--------------------------------------------------------------

- SCRIPTS
1. run go.js - it uses all free ram on HOME and bought servers. 

2. to launch other scripts (stop go.js):click Active Scripts -> HOME -> go.js . 
3. clcik LOG then red square button to stop go.js  or....
4. click red trashcan (to run again go.js youll need to use terminal or script editor so its easier to use option A)
5. also kill /stop lingering bin.js files on home , becasue they use up all the ram.


- DARKWEB - buy .exe programs instead of wasting time making them yourself.

1. go to company that sells servers and buy ROUTER to access dark web.
2. [connect darkweb] - connects to darkweb
3. [buy -l] - lists programs that you can buy
4. [buy -a] - buys all programs you can afford


- SERVERS
1. Travel to Volfhaven to buy 25 servers of 256GB for 14M $ each (352M total).
2. [run delete-server.js] to delete all bought servers
3. [run servbuy1b.js] to buy 512 GB servers. (710M needed)
4. [run delete-server.js] to delete all bought servers
5. [run servbuy2t.js] to max out servers (1,5t needed)



--------------------------------------------------------------



  STEP04 - make money MID and LATE game
--------------------------------------------------------------
  
1. Go to stock exchange and buy all upgrades (up to 25B). You dont have to buy again after resetting (installing augmentations).

2. [run stocktrader5.js] - it makes money by trading stocks every 8 seconds with LONG/SHORT position. Keeps 100M $ as minimum reserve (const moneyKeep)

3. SHORT position is unlocked after completing twice the main story in Bitnode 8 (you start game in Bitnode 1).
4. you can edit stocktrader5.js and change minimum safety treshold from 1B to 1 million to start making money before you reach 1 billion.
5. Also, early game edit scriptTimer = 2000 from 2000 ms to 30000 so that it makes buy/sell transaction only once in 30, becasue each transaction cost 100K. Stock prices change every 6 secodns.
6. I leave scriptTimer at 8000 (8 seconds), becasue those info popups are annoying and on top of text I try to read.



--------------------------------------------------------------

  CHEATING - If you find game too hard or too long, you can cheat by editing main game values such as Price and reputation requirements for augmentations.
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Find on google and isntall program for code editing called Notepad++.
2. Navigate to C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Bitburner\resources\app\dist or wherever your installed game files are.
3. In folder Bitburner\resources\app\dist find main.bundle.js
4. Cpoy and paste main.bundle.js to make a backup file in case you screw up during editing values and break the game. After that open main.bundle.js in Notepad++.
5. search for values like: repCost:37500,moneyCost:125e6 and edit the values to  make rep and $ lower.
6. e6 means scientific exponet format of numbers, where 125 is base value multiplied by 1 with 6 zeroes (1 000 000). 125e6 = 125 000 000. 125e2 = 125 00. 12e1 = 120.
7. Use search words such as REPCOST and MONEYCOST, faction names, augment names. You can edit by how much augments increase your stats and other aspects of the game.
