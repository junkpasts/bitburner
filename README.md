  End game strategy: 
1. run stocktrader5.js
2. run go.js
3. run server buy script. (stop go.js before buying))
4. make couple trillion $
5. upgrade HOME PC RAM and CORES
6. buy augments
7. install augments
8. until you have 2500 hack skill and you can join Daedalus.
   

  STEP01 - Copy files from github to bitburner HOME pc.

Create all of the files with exact file names on your HOME coputer in bitburner game by typing in terminal NANO FILENAME.js, then copy paste the code from github and click SAVE.

You can check what files you have on home PC by typing in terminal LS. type HELP for more commands. or read the beginner guide inside bitburner game under DOcumentation tab,
or help articles here: https://bitburner-fork-oddiz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basicgameplay/terminal.html


  STEP02 - make money EARLY GAME
  
CRIME
1. go to gym in Sector-12 and train Agility and Dexterity. Let the money go minus 1 million or more. you can train strenghth and defence later too.
2. go to Slums in sector-12 and start doing crime for money. you want dexterity and agility trained high enough so that crime success rate is 70% or higher.
3. Start with Shoplift, then MUG, then Homicide.

HACK skill
You can train hack skill in Sector-12 university. you can train faster in ZB UNI in Volfhaven.

HACKNET
Buy at least 4 hacknet nodes.
upgrade RAM (max 64gb), then LEVEL (max 200), then cores (max 16).
In early game buy some RAM and then some Levels, dont buy cores.
In mid and late game max out RAM, buy 150 levels, but buy only 10 cores. 14 nodes is enough to cover stock market costs.
In late game max out RAM, LEVELS, buy only 10 cores. u can max everything if u feel like it. stock market makes billions and trillions.
It does not pay off to max out cores or buy more than 14 hacknet nodes. 
You need to buy 30 hacknet nodes for steam achievment (around 1 trillion $)

SCRIPTS.
run early hack template.js
if you can run go.js

  STEP03 - MAKE HACK XP and hack level MID GAME

SCRIPTS
1. run go.js - it uses all free ram on HOME and bought servers. 


to launch other scripts (stop go.js):
click Active Scripts -> HOME -> go.js . 
A) clcik LOG then red squar button to stop go.js  or....
B) click red trashcan (to run again go.js youll need to use terminal or script editor so its easier to use option A)
also kill /stop lingering bin.js files on home , becasue they use up all the ram.

SERVERS
2. buy more servers (700M to 2B)
3. delete old servers and buy max servers (1,5 trillion $)

DARKWEB - buy .exe programs instead of wasting time making them yourself.

go to company that sells servers and buy ROUTER to access dark web.
connect darkweb - connects to darkweb
buy -l - lists programs that you can buy
buy -a - buys all programs you can afford

  STEP04 - make money MID and LATE game
1. Go to stock exchange and buy all upgrades (up to 25B). You dont have to buy again after resetting (installing augmentations).

2. run stocktrader5.js - it makes money with LONG position.

SHORT position is unlocked after completing twice the main story in Bitnode 8 (you start game in Bitnode 1).
you can edit stocktrader5.js and change minimum safety treshold from 1B to 1 million to start making money before you reach 1 billion.
Also, edit SLEEP time from 2000 ms to 30000 or 60000 so that it makes buy/sell transaction only once in 30 or 60 secods, becasue each transaction cost 100K.
I leave  SLEEP at 8000 (8 seconds), becasue those info popups are annoying and on top of text I try to read.




 
when you reach enough money to buy more servers, then stop go.js to free up ram on home pc. run server buy.js. Before launchig server you can manualy adjust hom much ram server
